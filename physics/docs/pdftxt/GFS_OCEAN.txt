\section des_sfcocean  Description

The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is a required filed in Numerical Weather Prediciton (NWP) systems because it 
functions as the lower foundary condition for the calculation of air-sea heat fluxes. When the GFS Simple Ocean
Scheme is evoked, the SST is kept constant throughout the forecast.
